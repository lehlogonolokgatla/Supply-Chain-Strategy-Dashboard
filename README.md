## üîë Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases a blend of technical implementation and strategic business thinking, directly targeting the responsibilities of an Operations and Strategy role.

#### **üîπ Strategic Planning & Scenario Analysis**
-   **Interactive Sidebar Controls:** Instantly model the impact of operational disruptions like a **truck breakdown** (by de-selecting active trucks) or market volatility like a **fuel price spike**.
-   **"What-If" Analysis:** Quantify the exact financial and operational impact of changing variables, demonstrating an ability to provide data-driven answers to executive questions.

#### **üîπ Logistics & Transportation Optimization**
-   **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver:** Implemented Google's OR-Tools to solve for the most efficient routes, minimizing total distance and operational cost.
-   **Capacity Utilization Tracking:** The "Per-Truck Performance" table analyzes the efficiency of each vehicle, highlighting opportunities for consolidation or fleet right-sizing.
-   **Sustainability & ESG Tracking:** The dashboard calculates the **estimated carbon footprint (CO‚ÇÇ) in kg** for the planned routes, aligning operational efficiency with modern sustainability goals.

#### **üîπ Inventory Management & Optimization**
-   **Statistical Safety Stock Calculation:** A dedicated module uses demand variability, lead times, and a desired service level (Z-score) to calculate the optimal safety stock.
-   **Dynamic Reorder Point Suggestion:** Provides clear, actionable recommendations on when to reorder inventory to prevent stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

#### **üîπ User-Centric Design & Automation**
-   **Custom Data Upload:** The application is not a static demo; it's a flexible tool that allows users to upload their own `Farms`, `Markets`, `Trucks`, and `Road Network` files for a fully custom analysis.
-   **Multi-Page Dashboard:** The application is structured logically into distinct modules, demonstrating an ability to build scalable and maintainable analytical tools.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Generate Sample Data (First Time Only):**
    This script creates the `data` folder and populates it with sample CSV and JSON files.
    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_dummy_data.py
    ```

2.  **Launch the Streamlit App:**
    This command starts the web server and opens the application in your browser.
    ```bash
    python -m streamlit run src/1_Home.py
    ```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.
